## Introduction

A complex number is of the form $a+ib$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i^{2} =-1$. Some examples are:

- $2+3i$
- $5-10i$
- $-i$

- $5i$

- $4$

The set of complex numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{C}$. Every real number is a complex number. But every complex number need not necessarily be a real number. In terms of set theoretic notation, $\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$ but $\mathbb{C} \not \subset \mathbb{R}$.

A complex number has two parts to it: real and imaginary part. For the complex number $2+3i$, the real part is $2$ and the imaginary part is $3$. Any complex number $z$ can be written as:
$$
\boxed{z=\text{Re}( z) +\text{Im}( z) \cdot i}
$$
 We can understand complex numbers geometrically by plotting the real part on the x-axis and the imaginary part on the y-axis.

This plane is called the complex plane, also called the Argand plane or Gauss plane.



## Algebra

The following are some of the operations that we can do on complex numbers:

- addition (subtraction)
- multiplication (division)
- absolute value or modulus
- conjugate

We will look at each one of these operations.

### Addition

Consider two complex numbers $z_{1} =a_{1} +ib_{1}$ and $z_{2} =a_{2} +ib_{2}$. Then:

$$
\begin{equation*}
z_{1} +z_{2} =( a_{1} +a_{2}) +i( b_{1} +b_{2})
\end{equation*}
$$
To add two complex numbers, we add the real part separately and the imaginary part separately. For example:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1 + 3i) + (-5 - 2i) &= (1 - 5) +i(3 - 2)\\
&= -4 + i
\end{aligned}
$$
Subtraction follows trivially. To compute $z_{1} -z_{2}$, we can just compute $z_{1} +( -z_{2})$.

### Multiplication

Consider two complex numbers $z_{1} =a_{1} +ib_{1}$ and $z_{2} =a_{2} +ib_{2}$. Then:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
z_{1} z_{2} & =( a_{1} +ib_{1})( a_{2} +ib_{2})\\
 & =a_{1} a_{2} +a_{1}( ib_{2}) +( ib_{1}) a_{2} +i^{2} b_{1} b_{2}\\
 & =a_{1} a_{2} +i( a_{1} b_{2}) +i( a_{2} b_{1}) -b_{1} b_{2}\\
 & =( a_{1} a_{2} -b_{1} b_{2}) +i( a_{1} b_{2} +a_{2} b_{1})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$
As an example, if $z_{1} =3-2i$ and $z_{2} =5+i$, then:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
z_{1} z_{2} & =( 3\times 5-( -2) \times 1) +i( 3\times 1+( -2) \times 5)\\
 & =17-7i
\end{aligned}\\
\end{gather*}
$$
Before moving to division, let us look at the idea of the absolute value of a complex number.

### Absolute Value

The absolute value of a complex number $z=a+ib$ is given by:
$$
\begin{equation*}
|z|=\sqrt{a^{2} +b^{2}}
\end{equation*}
$$
Geometrically, we can think about it as the distance of $z$ from the origin. For example, if $z=3+2i$, then $|z|=\sqrt{3^{2} +2^{2}} =\sqrt{13}$. The complex number (blue dot) is at a distance of $\sqrt{13}$ units from the origin.

Another term for the absolute value is modulus. The absolute value of a complex number is always going to be a real number.

### Conjugate

The conjugate of a complex number $z=a+ib$ is denoted by $\overline{z}$ and given as:

$$
\overline{z} = a - ib
$$
For example, if $z=3+2i$ then $\overline{z} =3-2i$. Geometrically, $\overline{z}$ is the reflection of $z$ around the x-axis:

The following is an interesting relation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
z\overline{z} =|z|^{2}
\end{equation*}
$$
To see why this is true, consider any complex number $z=a+ib$. Then:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
z\overline{z} & =( a+ib)( a-ib)\\
 & =a^{2} -a( ib) +( ib) a-i^{2} b^{2}\\
 & =a^{2} -i( ab) +i( ab) +b^{2}\\
 & =a^{2} +b^{2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$
Here is an observation related to conjugates that will be used quite extensively in subsequent lectures: $z=\overline{z}$ if and only if $z$ is a real number. To see why this is true, let $z=a+ib$. If $z$ is a real number, then $b=0$, and it is obvious that $z=\overline{z} =a$. On the other hand, if $z=\overline{z}$, then we have:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
a+ib & =a-ib\\
i( 2b) & =0\\
\Longrightarrow b & =0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$
It follows that $z=a$ and hence a real number.

### Division

Let us try to divide two complex numbers $z_{1} =a_{1} +ib_{1}$ and $z_{2} =a_{2} +ib_{2}$ with $z_{2} \neq 0$:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\cfrac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} & =\cfrac{a_{1} +ib_{1}}{a_{2} +ib_{2}}\\
 & =\cfrac{a_{1} +ib_{1}}{a_{2} +ib_{2}{}} \cdot \cfrac{a_{2} -ib_{2}}{a_{2} -ib_{2}}\\
 & =\cfrac{( a_{1} +ib_{1})( a_{2} -ib_{2})}{a_{2}^{2} +b_{2}^{2}}\\
 & =\cfrac{a_{1} a_{2} +b_{1} b_{2}}{a_{2}^{2} +b_{2}^{2}} +i\cdot \cfrac{a_{2} b_{1} -a_{1} b_{2}}{a_{2}^{2} +b_{2}^{2}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$

## Polar Coordinates

Consider a complex number $z = a + ib$

Using basic trigonometry, we have the following relations:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
r & =\sqrt{a^{2} +b^{2}}\\
 & \\
\cfrac{a}{r} & =\cos \theta \\
 & \\
\cfrac{b}{r} & =\sin \theta 
\end{aligned}\\
\end{gather*}
$$
Alternatively, we have:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
a & =r\cos \theta \\
b & =r\sin \theta 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$
So, the complex number $z$ can be written as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
z & =a+ib\\
 & =r\cos \theta +i( r\sin \theta )\\
 & =r(\cos \theta +i\sin \theta )
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$
The following result is stated without proof. If $e$ is the familiar Euler's number, then:
$$
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\theta } =\cos \theta +i\sin \theta 
\end{equation*}
$$
Using this result, we can write $z$ as:

$$
\begin{equation*}
z=re^{i\theta }
\end{equation*}
$$
$r$ is the absolute value of $z$ and $\theta$ is called the argument of $z$. This way of representing a complex number using its modulus (absolute value) and argument is called the polar coordinate representation. Using this representation, the conjugate of $z=a+ib$ can be written as follows:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\overline{z} & =a-ib\\
 & =r(\cos \theta -i\sin \theta )\\
 & =r[\cos( -\theta ) +i\sin( -\theta )]\\
 & =re^{-i\theta }
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$
We have used the fact that $\cos(-\theta ) =\cos \theta$ and $\sin(-\theta ) =-\sin \theta$. The geometric interpretation of the conjugate under the polar coordinates is as follows:
