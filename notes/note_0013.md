Some questions concerning similar matrices:

- If $A$ and $B$ are similar, is $AB$ similar to $BA$?
- Are any two invertible matrices of the same order similar?
- Given two square matrices $A$ and $B$ of the same order, how does one determine if they are similar or not? Refer to this [link](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/14075/how-do-i-tell-if-matrices-are-similar?rq=1) for a discussion on this question.
