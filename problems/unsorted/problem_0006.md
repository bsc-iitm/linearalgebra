## Question

Select all true statements.

(a) The intersection of two subspaces of a vector space is a subspace.

(b) The union of two subspaces of a vector space is a subspace.

(c) The empty set is a subspace of every vector space.

(d) Every subset of a vector space need not be a subspace

## Solution


Options (a) and (d) are correct. As a counter example for the second option, consider two subspaces for $\mathbb{R}^{2}$: the x-axis and the y-axis. Their union is not a subspace as it is not closed under vector addition. The third option is incorrect as every vector space ought to have the zero element.
