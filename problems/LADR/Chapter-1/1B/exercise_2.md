## Exercise [^1]

Suppose $a \in \mathbf{F}, v \in V$, and $av = 0$. Prove that $a = 0$ or $v = 0$.

## Solution

Let us assume that $a \neq 0$ to begin with:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= 1v\\
  &= \left(a \cdot \cfrac{1}{a} \right) v\\
  &= \cfrac{1}{a} (a v)\\
  &= \cfrac{1}{a} 0\\
  &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

We have shown that if $a \neq 0$ then $v = 0$. If $v \neq 0$ then $a$ has to be $0$. This is just the contrapositive of what has been proven.
