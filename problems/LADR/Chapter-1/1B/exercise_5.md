## Exercise [^1]

Show that in the definition of a vector space, the additive inverse condition can be replaced with the condition that

$$
0v = 0 \text{ for all } v \in V
$$

## Solution

The only property we need to check is the existence of the additive inverse for all elements. Let $v \in V$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0v &= (1 + (-1))v\\
   &= 1v + (-1)v\\
   &= v + (-1)v
\end{aligned}
$$

This shows that $(-1)v$ is the additive inverse of $v$. Since $v$ was some arbitrary element in $v$, this holds good for all elements in $V$.
