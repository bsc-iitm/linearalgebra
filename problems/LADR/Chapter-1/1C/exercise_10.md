## Exercise [^1]

Suppose $V_1$ and $V_2$ are subspaces of $V$. Prove that the intersection $V_1 \cap V_2$ is a subspace of $V$.

## Solution

### Step-1

$0 \in V_1$ and $0 \in V_2$, hence $0 \in V_1 \cap V_2$.

### Step-2

If $u, v \in V_1 \cap V_2$, then, $u + v \in V_1 \cap V_2$. This is because $u, v \in V_1 \implies u + v \in V_1$ and $u, v \in V_2 \implies u + v \in V_2$.

### Step-3

If $u \in V_1 \cap V_2$, then $\lambda u \in V_1 \cap V_2$. The argument is similar to the one followed in step-2.

### Step-4

Since $V_1 \cap V_2$ has the identity element of $V$, is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication, it is a subspace of $V$.
