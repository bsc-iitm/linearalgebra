## Question

If $A$ is an orthogonal matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, then which of the following statements are true?

(a) $A$ has orthonormal columns.

(b) $Ax = b$ has a unique solution.

(c) $Ax = b$ has no solutions.

(d) $Ax = b$ has infinitely many solutions.

## Solution


Options (a) and (b) are correct.



A $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is orthogonal if its columns are orthonormal. It follows that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent. This implies that $A$ is invertible and $Ax = b$ has a unique solution. It is to be noted that the columns of an orthogonal matrix have to be orthonormal and not just orthogonal.
