An assorted collection of notes. This is the first point of entry for all ideas related to linear algebra. Think of this like a scratch space. 

::: {.callout-warning}

Most of the notes have not been reviewed for correctness. Several of them are still in a nebulous stage. Proceed with caution if you plan to read any of them. Accuracy of content is NOT guaranteed.
